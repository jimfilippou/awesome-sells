# Awesome Sells &nbsp; ![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)

A curated list of developer landing pages that sell physical or digital products. Inspired by https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses, we aim to provide a list of self-hosted or third-party services that developers use to sell their products, whether they are physical or digital.
