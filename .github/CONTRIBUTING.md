## What's a Sells Page?

A `/sells` page lists a developer's dedicated page to list items or courses for sale. It's a great reference for those looking to purchase items or courses.

**The URL MUST follow the format of sell|sells|selling|courses at the end.** 

### What Should I Include?

Include your physical items that you would like to sell and also mention where you can deliver the items. You can also promote your courses but it is required for your course or service to be purchasable from your website (no middlemans).

## Adding Your Page

* Ensure you are linking to a /sells page, **not just your website**
* Ensure your data is formatted like other entries
* Do not add yourself to the end of the array (add yourself somewhere random instead)
* Ensure this PR has a title in the following format
    * ✅ Add Your Name
    * ✅ Add @twitterusername
    * ❌ Add myself
    * ❌ Adding myself!
    * ❌ Add Your Name @twitter @github

## Code Modifications

* Ensure the code submitted is formatted similarly to existing code.
